In this method, the client sends a request to the server to retrieve data and the response sent back from the server is displayed to the user.

The server processes the data and sends back a response. This method is used for creating, updating, or deleting data on the server. Unlike the GET method, the data is not visible in the URL, which makes it more secure for sensitive data such as user passwords. \n",

    "Request is a module used in Flask to handle incoming HTTP requests from clients sending requests to a Flask web application. When a client (typically a web browser) sends a request to the Flask server, the server needs to handle this request and generate a response to send back to the client. \n",
    "\n",
    "The request module in Flask provides a way to access the request data, such as the HTTP method used (GET, POST, etc.), headers, and any submitted data, such as form data or JSON payloads. This information can then be used by the Flask application to create dynamic responses based on the specific request data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the request module can be used to retrieve form data submitted by a user and perform validation checks on that data. Once the data is validated, the application can use the data to generate a customized response to the user. \n",

    "Overall, the request module is an essential part of the Flask framework, allowing web applications to handle incoming requests and generate dynamic responses based on the data received."
